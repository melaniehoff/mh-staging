Dance Poem Revolution is an interactive installation where participants generate poems through movement. Using a custom-built system inspired by and reimagined from the popular game Dance Dance Revolution. The piece generates writing sourced from revolutionary texts, songs, and local histories in response to players' steps. The project explores how critical theory can be part of an embodied, poetic, joyful, and communal storytelling. Materials generated through workshops will feed back into the game, adding original text and video sources so that the game is shaped by each place it is installed and those who engage with it.
